In a directory that contains .pwbuild script, one can put ${name}.pwinfo file,
where ${name} is a value of name variable in .pwbuild script.

In .pwinfo file, some variables should be defined. They include:

info - short description of package, half line long.

desc - longer description.

desc field is automatically formated during building package. A way of
formatting is illustrated by attached files. File janosik.pwinfo is an example
of such file. File slack-desc is an output file, generated from janosik.pwinfo.
slack-desc can't have more than eleven lines. One paragraph should be written
in one line, without breaking a line.

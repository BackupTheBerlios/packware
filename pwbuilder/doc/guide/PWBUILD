_doc [-d] [-b subdirectory] [-r directory] [-s N] [-x file] [files]

Points to files that will be put as documentation in
/usr/doc/${name}-${version} directory. Files are separated with space. Their
location is relative to source directory. This command can be used many times.

ABOUT-NLS file will be copied, too. With this option you can still define
addtional files in a normal way.

-b subdirectory - look for -d files in given subdirectory rather that top
level directory of sources.

-s N - the default source if the first one. This option allows to change the
source number.

-x file - exclude file from automatically selected files. This option can be
used many times.

pwbuilder automatically sets some variables for make install called by
_install. Those variables include:

DESTDIR=${pkg}
INSTALLROOT=${pkg}
INSTALL_ROOT=${pkg}
PERL_INSTALL_ROOT=${pkg}
INSTALL_PREFIX=${pkg}

Thus it's not required to put in .pwbuilds commands like:

_i_opt DESTDIR=${pkg}

If for some reason these definitions break make install, you can turn them off
by passing -u option to _install.

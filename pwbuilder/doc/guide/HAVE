There are commands available for .pwbuild script that allow to check installed
software. Examples include:

_have_openssl && _c_opt --with-openssl
_have_mysql && _c_opt --with-mysql

_have_* commands return 0 if software exists, or 1 if it doesn't. To know what
_have_* commands are available, look into /usr/lib/pwbuilder/include/have
directory.

_have_* commands have been used ie. in php or sylpheed-claws packages.

pwbuilder has an ability to create subpackages. First, in .pwbuil script there
should be _sub command to define a subpackage, ie.:

_sub libgadu

and the subpackage will be named ${subpackage}, not ${name}-${subpackage}.
Second is to define a list of files and directories that will get into the
subpackage. It is done by creating ${subpackage}.pwsub file. Example content:

/usr/include
/usr/lib
/usr/doc/ekg-${version}/api.txt
/usr/doc/ekg-${version}/protocol.html
/usr/doc/ekg-${version}/functions.txt

As you can see, we can use variables defined in .pwbuild. And they are not only
name, version and build variables, but any variables declared in .pwbuild
script. Warning: names of variables must be enclosed in {} brackets, we can't
write just $version.
Optionally, we can create .pwinfo files for subpackages, named
${subpackage}.pwinfo.

Full ekg package source that makes use of subpackages feature can be found
in out CVS.
